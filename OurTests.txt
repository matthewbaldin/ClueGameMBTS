testDoorwayDirection:

	After selecting four different cells that serve as doors, each 
	with a different direction for the door, we picked cells that 
	reside within the middle of the board and at the bottom right corner
	of the board.

	We chose these cells because it ensures that our tests are able to check
	that the "middle" and "last" values are being read in correctly.

testInitials:
	
	The cells we picked cover a large variety of rooms types including the walkway 
	and closet types, and the cells reside in a wide variety of positions from the 
	"beginning" of values being read in to the "last" values.
